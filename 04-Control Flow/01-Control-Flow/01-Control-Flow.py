# sequencing- It means that the computer will run your code in order, one line at a time from the top to the bottom.
print("3")
print("building")

# Iteration- is about executing a number of instructions repeatedly. Iteration is commonly represented as a loop.

# Selection- chooses what path a program takes

# An algorithm- is a set of step-by-step instructions placed in the correct  order to complete a task.

# A flowchart- will help you to visualize an algorithm.

# Another way to represent an algorithm is with pseudocode. Pseudocode is a simplified language that is a bit closer to a programming language.
