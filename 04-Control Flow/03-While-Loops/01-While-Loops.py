# While loops are powerful because they can be used even when the number of iterations is unknown
# While loops repeat code whilst a condition holds true.
# Loops usually include counters. A counter- is a variable that keeps track of the number of iterations.

seats = 500 # initial number of seats
while seats > 0: # seat available?
  print("Sell ticket") # ticket sold
  seats = seats - 1 # number of seats updated
