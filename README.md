## Writing Code
- ðŸŒŸ humans use code to give `instructions` to machines
- ðŸŒŸ the `print()` instruction displays a message on the screen.
```
print("Welcome")
```

## Memory & Variables
- Computer programs use `variables` to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.
- The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called item.
- Variables have a name and a value. To create a variable, you just need to give it a name, then connect the name with the value you need to store using the equal sign =.
```
item = "bike"
company = "Google"
device = "Ipad"
message = "Level Up"
job = "designer"
```

## Text Data
- ðŸŒŸ A piece of text is called a `string`

- ðŸŒŸ Strings require `quotation marks`

- ðŸŒŸ The `print()` statement is used to send a value to the screen.
```
"The Lord of the rings"
company = "Apple"
month = 'April'
print("Welcome to the Code Playground")
```

## Numerical Data
- ðŸŒŸ Numerical values can be stored in variables

- ðŸŒŸ You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name

- ðŸŒŸ Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks.
```
population = 25000
pages = 310
print(280)
print(7 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
print(5 * 3)
print(10 / 2)
```

## Working with Variables
ðŸŒŸ You can run calculations using the values stored in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can store the result of a calculation in a variable

ðŸŒŸ Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.
```
size = "medium"
age = 34

price = 150
print(price)

budget = 20
print(budget + 10)

price = 5
amount = 3
print(price * amount)

# reasigning a variable
points = 35
points = 45
print(points)
```

## Debugging
<img src="./images/debugging.png" style="width:300px" />

ðŸŒŸ Errors in code are known as bugs

ðŸŒŸ Code is executed line by line from top to bottom

ðŸŒŸ Code execution is interrupted by bugs.

## Standards and Best Practices
ðŸŒŸ You can add comments to your code with the hash symbol #

ðŸŒŸ Python is a `case-sensitive` language

ðŸŒŸ `Snake case` is the best practice when creating multi-word variable names.

## Applying Best Practices
ðŸŒŸ spaces are not allowed in variable names

ðŸŒŸ a variable name cannot start with a number

ðŸŒŸ best practices can help you avoid errors.
```
account_balance = 350
print(account_balance)

format = "mp3"
print(format)

device_type = "Ipad"
print(device_type)

salary = 900
new_salary = salary + 200
print(new_salary)
```

## Inputs and Outputs
ðŸŒŸ inputs and outputs help machines communicate with the outside world

ðŸŒŸ the input() instruction allows the user to enter a value into your program

ðŸŒŸ the print() instruction is used to generate an output.
```
message = input()
print(message)

user_entry = input() # asks the user for a value that gets stored in a variable called user_entry
```

## Data Types
ðŸŒŸ `data types` tell computers how to store, process and operate different types of data

ðŸŒŸ `string` is the data type for text

ðŸŒŸ `integer` and `float` are data types for numbers.
```
# String - surrounded by quotation marks
item = "Nintendo"

# Integers - numbers (positive, negative or zero)
item = 2

# Float - numbers with decimal places (they can be positive or negative)
item = 3.14
variable = 5/2 # stores 2.5

print(3 + 5) # => 8
print("Iron" + "Man") # => IronMan
```

## Data Type Checking
ðŸŒŸ the `type()` instruction is used to check the data type

ðŸŒŸ the division of two integers always produces a `float`.
```
city = "Berlin" #stores a string
age = 42 #stores an integer
balance = 830.29 #stores a float
print(type(city)) #outputs <class 'str'>
print(type(age)) #outputs <class 'int'>
print(type(balance)) #outputs <class 'float'>
```
## Data Conversion
ðŸŒŸ you can change the data type of a value with `int()`, `float()` and `str()`

ðŸŒŸ there are `implicit` and `explicit` data type conversions in Python

ðŸŒŸ str(), int(), float() instructions are explicit conversions.
```
birth_year = input()
print(type(birth_year)) # => <class 'str'>

x = "55" #x is a string
y = int(x) #y is an integer

height = int(input())

a = 3
b = float(a)
print(b) # => 3.0
```

## Comparison Operations
<img src="./images/chip.png" style="width: 400px" />

ðŸŒŸ the Boolean data type has one of two possible values: True or False

ðŸŒŸ a comparison operation always results in a Boolean.
```
# the result of comparison operators is either "True" or "False"
print(30 < 25)
print(5 < 9)
print(50 > 100)

# Boolean is a data type that has one of two possible values: True or False.
print(type(5 < 9))
print(type(50 > 100))
```

## Logical Operations
ðŸŒŸ take multiple Boolean values as input

ðŸŒŸ produce a single Boolean value as output

ðŸŒŸ "and" and "or" are examples of logical operations.
```
print(True and False)
print(False and True)
print(True or False)
print(False or True)
```

## Combining Comparison and Logical Operations
ðŸŒŸ You can store boolean values in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can store the result of logical and comparison operations in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can combine operations with logical and comparison operators.
```
light_on = True
door_locked = False
print(light_on or door_locked)

temp = 35
ac_on = temp > 30
print(ac_on)

a = (3 > 2) or False
```
## Control Flow
ðŸŒŸ you use `sequencing`, `iteration` and `selection` to control the flow of instructions

ðŸŒŸ an `algorithm` is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task

ðŸŒŸ `algorithm`s can be represented in different ways.
```
# sequencing- It means that the computer will run your code in order, one line at a time from the top to the bottom.
print("3")
print("building")
print("blocks")

# Iteration- is about executing a number of instructions repeatedly. Iteration is commonly represented as a loop.

# Selection- chooses what path a program takes

# An algorithm- is a set of step-by-step instructions placed in the correct  order to complete a task.

# A flowchart- will help you to visualize an algorithm.

# Another way to represent an algorithm is with pseudocode. Pseudocode is a simplified language that is a bit closer to a programming language.
```

## For Loops
<img src="./images/For-Loops.png" style="height:200px" />

ðŸŒŸ you can implement iteration into your programs with the for loop

ðŸŒŸ the initial loop statement must be followed by a colon : symbol

ðŸŒŸ the code that gets repeated must be indented. 
```
#Define the number of iterations
for i in range(3):
  #Statement that gets repeated
  print("Hello") # => prints Hello 3x

for i in range(100):
  print("Hello") # => prints Hello 100x

for i in range(10):
  print(i) # => prints 0 - 9

for i in range(5):
    print("Congrats!") # => prints Congrats! 5x

for num in range(5):
print("Coding is fun!") # => prints error bcz-the code that gets repeated must be indented

for num in range(6)
  print(num) # => prints error bcz-missing colon : symbol
```

## While Loops
ðŸŒŸ you can implement iteration into your programs with the `while loop`

ðŸŒŸ `counters` keep track of the number of iterations and avoid infinite loops

ðŸŒŸ `indentation` and the `colon : symbol` are required for the code to run.
```
seats = 500 # initial number of seats
while seats > 0: # seat available?
  print("Sell ticket") # ticket sold
  seats = seats - 1 # number of seats updated
```

## Conditional Statements
ðŸŒŸ if-else statements are used to implement selection into your programs

ðŸŒŸ the colon : symbol and the use of indentation are needed to prevent errors.
```
#sets the value of age
age = 22
if age >= 18:
  # executed only if customer is over-age
  print("Regular price") 
else:
  #executed only if age is less than 18
  print("Discount")

age = 30
if age >= 18:
  print("Regular price")
else:
  print("Discount")
print("Proceed to payment")

is_student = False
age = 16
print(is_student and (age < 18))

age = 32
is_student = True
if age < 18 or is_student:
  print("Discount")
else: 
  print("Regular price")

age = 75
if age < 18: 
  print("Junior discount")
elif age >= 75: 
  print("Senior discount")
else:
  print("No discount")
print("Proceed to payment")
```
## Lists
```
# Lists are used to store items. 
# We can create a list by using square brackets with commas separating items. Like this:
# If you want to access a certain item in the list, you can do this by using its index in square brackets.
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
print(words[0])
print(words[1])
print(words[2]) 

# Lists can hold different data types, such as strings and numbers.
x = ["a", "b", "c"]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(x[1])
print(y[3])

# we can use nested lists to represent 2D grids, such as matrices
m = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
    ]

# To access the elements of a matrix, we specify the row and the column of the item using square brackets:
m = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
    ]
    
print(m[1][2]) # => 6

# Strings can be indexed like lists too!
str = "Hello world!"
print(str[6]) # => w
```
