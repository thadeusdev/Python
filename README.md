## Hello world
```
print("Hello world)
```

## Simple Operations
```
print(2 + 2)
print(5 + 4 - 3)
print(10 / 2)
print(2 * (3 + 4))
```
- Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it’s known in programming)

## Quotient & Remainder
### Quotient
#### floor division
- ``Quotient`` just means the quantity produced by the division of two numbers.
- ``Floor division`` is done using two forward slashes and is used to determine the ``quotient`` of a division.
```
print(20 // 6) # => 3
```

### Remainder
#### modulo operator
- ``modulo operator``–which is carried out with a percent symbol (%)–to get the remainder of a given division.
```
print(20 % 6) # => 2
print(1.25 % 0.5) # => 0.25
```
