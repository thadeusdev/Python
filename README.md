## Writing Code
- ðŸŒŸ humans use code to give `instructions` to machines
- ðŸŒŸ the `print()` instruction displays a message on the screen.
```
print("Welcome")
```

## Memory & Variables
- Computer programs use `variables` to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.
- The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called item.
- Variables have a name and a value. To create a variable, you just need to give it a name, then connect the name with the value you need to store using the equal sign =.
```
item = "bike"
company = "Google"
device = "Ipad"
message = "Level Up"
job = "designer"
```

## Text Data
- ðŸŒŸ A piece of text is called a `string`

- ðŸŒŸ Strings require `quotation marks`

- ðŸŒŸ The `print()` statement is used to send a value to the screen.
```
"The Lord of the rings"
company = "Apple"
month = 'April'
print("Welcome to the Code Playground")
```

## Numerical Data
- ðŸŒŸ Numerical values can be stored in variables

- ðŸŒŸ You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name

- ðŸŒŸ Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks.
```
population = 25000
pages = 310
print(280)
print(7 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
print(5 * 3)
print(10 / 2)
```

## Working with Variables
ðŸŒŸ You can run calculations using the values stored in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can store the result of a calculation in a variable

ðŸŒŸ Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.
```
size = "medium"
age = 34

price = 150
print(price)

budget = 20
print(budget + 10)

price = 5
amount = 3
print(price * amount)

# reasigning a variable
points = 35
points = 45
print(points)
```

## Debugging
<img src="./images/debugging.png" style="width:300px" />

ðŸŒŸ Errors in code are known as bugs

ðŸŒŸ Code is executed line by line from top to bottom

ðŸŒŸ Code execution is interrupted by bugs.

## Standards and Best Practices
ðŸŒŸ You can add comments to your code with the hash symbol #

ðŸŒŸ Python is a `case-sensitive` language

ðŸŒŸ `Snake case` is the best practice when creating multi-word variable names.

## Applying Best Practices
ðŸŒŸ spaces are not allowed in variable names

ðŸŒŸ a variable name cannot start with a number

ðŸŒŸ best practices can help you avoid errors.
```
account_balance = 350
print(account_balance)

format = "mp3"
print(format)

device_type = "Ipad"
print(device_type)

salary = 900
new_salary = salary + 200
print(new_salary)
```

## Inputs and Outputs
ðŸŒŸ inputs and outputs help machines communicate with the outside world

ðŸŒŸ the input() instruction allows the user to enter a value into your program

ðŸŒŸ the print() instruction is used to generate an output.
```
message = input()
print(message)

user_entry = input() # asks the user for a value that gets stored in a variable called user_entry
```

## Data Types
ðŸŒŸ `data types` tell computers how to store, process and operate different types of data

ðŸŒŸ `string` is the data type for text

ðŸŒŸ `integer` and `float` are data types for numbers.
```
# String - surrounded by quotation marks
item = "Nintendo"

# Integers - numbers (positive, negative or zero)
item = 2

# Float - numbers with decimal places (they can be positive or negative)
item = 3.14
variable = 5/2 # stores 2.5

print(3 + 5) # => 8
print("Iron" + "Man") # => IronMan
```

## Data Type Checking
ðŸŒŸ the `type()` instruction is used to check the data type

ðŸŒŸ the division of two integers always produces a `float`.
```
city = "Berlin" #stores a string
age = 42 #stores an integer
balance = 830.29 #stores a float
print(type(city)) #outputs <class 'str'>
print(type(age)) #outputs <class 'int'>
print(type(balance)) #outputs <class 'float'>
```
## Data Conversion
ðŸŒŸ you can change the data type of a value with `int()`, `float()` and `str()`

ðŸŒŸ there are `implicit` and `explicit` data type conversions in Python

ðŸŒŸ str(), int(), float() instructions are explicit conversions.
```
birth_year = input()
print(type(birth_year)) # => <class 'str'>

x = "55" #x is a string
y = int(x) #y is an integer

height = int(input())

a = 3
b = float(a)
print(b) # => 3.0
```

## Comparison Operations
<img src="./images/chip.png" style="width: 400px" />

ðŸŒŸ the Boolean data type has one of two possible values: True or False

ðŸŒŸ a comparison operation always results in a Boolean.
```
# the result of comparison operators is either "True" or "False"
print(30 < 25)
print(5 < 9)
print(50 > 100)

# Boolean is a data type that has one of two possible values: True or False.
print(type(5 < 9))
print(type(50 > 100))
```
