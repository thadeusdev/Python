## Memory & Variables
- Computer programs use `variables` to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.
- The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called item.
- Variables have a name and a value. To create a variable, you just need to give it a name, then connect the name with the value you need to store using the equal sign =.
```
item = "bike"
company = "Google"
device = "Ipad"
message = "Level Up"
job = "designer"
```
